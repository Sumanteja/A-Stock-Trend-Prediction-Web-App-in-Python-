## Introduction

Stock trend prediction is an essential task for investors and traders to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices and provides visualizations to analyze the predicted trends.

## Features

- Predict stock prices of various companies.
- Visualize the predicted trends alongside actual stock prices.
- Compare actual and predicted prices with moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200).
- Customize predictions for different time periods.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/nithinchowdary2532/stock-trend-prediction.git
   cd stock-trend-prediction

# Summarize
- Utilizes Gemini to comprehensively analyze educational textbooks.
- Extracts key points, formulas, and dates, condensing each subtopic into concise summaries.
- Presents summarized content using text, markdowns, and tables, enhancing accessibility and understanding for students.

# Story Time
- Utilizes cutting-edge stable diffusion technology, meticulously fine-tuned on summarized educational data.
- Generates story-like presentations combining images and text from the summarized content.
- Transforms dense textbook material into engaging and fun stories, aiding comprehension and retention for children with dyslexia or ADHD.
- Presents the content seamlessly in the form of an image carousel for a visually appealing and immersive experience.

## Chat with Us
- Utilizes Gemini technology trained on textbook content to power a user-friendly chatbot.
- Enables students to ask questions pertaining to textbook concepts and receive accurate answers.
- Incorporates a feature to answer questions even if they are out of the textbook context by leveraging information from the internet.

## Text2Speech
- Implements Text2Speech functionality to convert displayed information into speech, catering to various learning preferences, particularly for cognitively challenged children.
- Offers customization options, allowing users to select accents for a personalized learning experience.
-Enhances the learning process by providing audio support, accommodating diverse learning styles and preferences, including the option to choose accents.

## Quiz
- Implements a quiz feature to test students on the chapter they have just learned using interactive learning methods.
- Utilizes multiple-choice questions (MCQs) format with point-based scoring system for each question.
- Gamifies the self-evaluation process, encouraging students to improve their performance with each attempt and enhancing engagement in learning process.
